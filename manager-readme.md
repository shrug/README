## Introduction

My name is Rob Braden(pronouns he/him) and I am an engineering leader. I currently live in Portland, OR, USA (PDT, currently UTC -7:00) with my wife and son, and I have an adult daughter as well. 

Most of my career has been with operations or ops-adjacent teams. I have a strong affinity for DevOps and SRE practices and philosophies: consistency, standards, reproducability, automation and toil reduction. I care about ensuring that teams follow good practices that help facilitate the work without adding unnecessary friction. We are focused on delivering good results for our customers. Our work should be rooted in a solid understanding of the problems that we are solving and well-defined desired outcomes.


## Meetings

### 1:1's
I will have regular dedicated meetings with engineers that report to me; a 1:1. Meetings may need to be moved during the week, but the idea is to have some dedicated time to talk where ideas or concerns can be discussed. Each individual owns the agenda and objective of the meeting: the 1:1 can be used as a status update, though I prefer to talk about things that are on top-of-mind, such as solving problems or personal life. You do not need to wait for a scheduled 1:1 to talk about anything at all, feel free to rech out or schedule something as-needed.

### General Working Hours
My "working hours" are the times that I'm typically at my desk, available for meetings. It doesn't mean that I'll immediately see an email or a Slack message, but it increases the chances that I will. While you can reach out outside of those hours, please do not expect replies until the following day (barring emergencies). In an emergency I am always available 24/7 via phone or PagerDuty.

**Monday through Friday**

_08:00 PDT - 17:30 PDT_

_15:00 UTC - 00:30 UTC_

### General Availability
I try to be as open with my schedule as possible. My (virtual) door is always open. You do not need to ask me if you can schedule a meeting directly; simply schedule it and I'll accept if I can attend. 

## My Guiding Principles

### Be Transparent
I default to full transparency, barring legal or confidentiality issues. If I am able to talk about something, I am happy to. An important part of my job is to give the team as much context as possible to help guide the work and enable the team to make good decisions. If there is something you are interested in, just ask and I will be happy to discuss it (assuming no other constraints).

### Patience, Especially With People
Not everyone is you and not everyone may be having a good day/month/year/decade. 

### Giving Feedback 
Feedback is a foundational component of personal and professional development at all levels. I am always open to receiving constructive feedback. I will also strive to give good, actionable feedback.

### Make It Work, Then Make It Work Better
You may have also heard this as "perfect is the enemy of good", but what it comes down to is "make something happen". Focusing on making the perfect product the first time is a perfectionists trap. Work on scoping the work down to the bare requirements, set a schedule, then work on it until it's done. Once your "it" is done, then worry about the features you wanted. 

### Mistakes Happen
We all make mistakes. Taking this a step further, if we are not making mistakes it suggests that we are being overly cautious. What's important is that we learn from our mistakes. Blameless post-incident processes and leaving comments in code about attempted changes are great ways to learn and ensure we don't make the same mistake twice. 

### Small Changes Over Time
Making smaller changes over time will eventually impact the larger work. This can be small, frequent deploys to a production service. It can also be minor changes to a habit over time, eventually realizing you've remembered to take a daily vitamin for a month. Whatever it is you want to do, make sure you work your way to it. 

### Work/Life Balance Exists
We've all got personal lives, myself included. Do your best to set working hours and stick to them, that way people understand when you are working. There are times when we may need to work outside of our preferred hours, but this should always be an exception and not a norm.


## Extra Information

### Music
I listen to music from a lot of different styles, genres and eras but I'm always looking for new stuff to listen to! I typically tend towards rock, punk and metal genres but anything is fair game.

### Pets
Currently just 1 tiny dog, Pretzel - 9-ish year-old Terrier/Chihuahua mix. Small dog, huge personality. 

### Coffee
Coffee is life. Current daily driver is pourovers (from a variety of roasters) in a Kalita Wave. Occasional Aeropress. Dreaming of enough kitchen space for an espresso machine.
